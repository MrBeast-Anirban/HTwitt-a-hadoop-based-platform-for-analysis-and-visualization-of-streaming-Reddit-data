But are there examples of lakes behind mountains where the water of the lake crushed through the mountains and so created a river and then up in the sea or ocean? With the lake still existing (though probably less full). I want to create an imaginary map where there are lakes behind the mountains and the water got through the mountains (canyon) to the lake, but of course",

TS Ophelia just passed by, luckily no damage, just lots of rain and some minor wind. I’m referring to how the system seems to widen from the tight rotation at sea. You can see from the attached picture that it has big spaces that aren’t showing up on radar. Also curious why they seem to speed up after landfall. That seems counterintuitive to me, but it could be due to my geographical location in N",

He kept marveling about how amazing the the strength of the water was. He bent his knees to keep his balance. But guess what? Viewers couldn't see a thing because Fox put a huge, high banner across the whole bottom of the TV screen, blocking our view of everything Robert talked about. If he had fallen down on the ground, we wouldn't have seen him at all. About 8:15pm CDT.",
